# Interactive React App Project

This document outlines the user story and acceptance criteria for a simple, interactive web application. As the developer, your task is to choose a problem to solve and build an application that meets the criteria below.

### Project Goal

Build an interactive single-page application that fetches data from a public API and presents it to the user in a clean, intuitive interface.

### User Story

You will define the user story for your application. Use the following template:

As a [type of user],

I want [to perform some action],

So that [I can achieve some goal].

Example:

As a movie enthusiast, I want to search for movies by title, so that I can see their ratings and a brief summary.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria:

- AC1: User Input: The user must be able to provide input to the application (e.g., through a search field, form, or other UI element).

- AC2: Trigger Action: The user must be able to trigger the primary action of the app, such as fetching data, by interacting with an element like a button or by pressing the "Enter" key.

- AC3: Display Data: After a successful data fetch, the application must display the results in a clear and organized manner (e.g., a list or grid of items).

- AC4: Detailed View: The application should provide a way to view more details about a single item from the results list.

- AC5: Handle No Results/Errors: If the API call returns no results or an error occurs, the application must display a user-friendly message.

- AC6: Data Persistence: Data fetched from the API must be saved to the browser's localStorage. When the page is refreshed, this data should be reloaded and displayed, preventing the need for a new API call.

## Non-Functional & Technical Criteria:

- AC7: Technology Stack: The application must be built using Vite as the build tool and React as the UI library.

- AC8: API Integration: The application must fetch data from a public API of your choosing. You can find a comprehensive list of public APIs here.

- AC9: useRef Hook Implementation: The project must use the useRef hook at least once. A good use case is to manage focus on a primary input field when the application loads.

- AC10: Visual Design: The user interface should be clean, modern, and visually appealing. The layout must be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- AC11: State Management: The application state (e.g., user input, API results, loading status, errors) must be managed effectively within React components using hooks like useState and useEffect.
